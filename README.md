# backtick
A javascript hypertext preprocessor for nodejs

## Why is it better?
Because backtick is familar, yet different. 
It uses source files written in javascript's template literal syntax to generate content. This can be used for generating config files, 
or with help of a web-server it can serve dynamic html like php does. Backtick runs in a nodejs environment, which means you have access to npm modules
